/* bpfbench.bt - A bpftrace implementation of bpfbench.py.
 * Uses: Linux, eBPF, bpftrace.
 *
 * Currently supports x86_64 architecture. Support for other architectures
 * is not guaranteed. If you find that this software supports your
 * architecture or wish to add support for your architecture, please submit
 * a PR.
 *
 * What's kind of insane is that the source code for this software is shorter
 * than this block of comments. The original bpfbench software was over 1000
 * lines of Python and C. Go bpftrace!
